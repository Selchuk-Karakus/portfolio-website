          <p>
            In late December 2018, I decided to focus my efforts on teaching
            myself how to code to a professional level. This idea came about
            coincidently, taking the advice of a stranger who had dined as a
            guest at the restaurant I was managing at the time - this sparked my
            interest in programming.
            <br />
            <br />
            It didn't take long before I realised the value of putting myself
            out there, asking loads of questions to professional developers, and
            adopting a headfirst learning approach. Less than a year ago, I
            found a community with a great support network through
            CodeYourFuture, where I did an eight-month, part-time Software
            Developer programme. I was surrounded by self-motivated, highly
            driven co-trainees daily in a family-like environment supported by
            volunteers from the tech industry.
            <br />
            <br />
            In this eight months part-time training I would be covering a broad range
            of software development skills (<strong>P.E.R.N Stack</strong>) and
            methodologies (<strong>Agile</strong>) and put them into practice on
            a final team project, day after day, week after week at
            CodeYourFuture, a family-like learning environment.
            <br />
            <br />
            Throughout the journey I have gained valuable skills which I hope
            will transform me into a
            <strong> Full Stack JavaScript Developer</strong>. I have a real
            passion for code. And, I want to pursue my passion to become a
            Software Developer in a sector driven by life extended education
            model where curiosity, creativity and problem-solving are nurtured
            and rewarded.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is this cycle of transparent knowledge sharing and the excitement
            of never being short of learning a new skill a new way to write code
            that made me feel at home in the CodeYourFuture community. Iâ€™m
            interested in organisations that share my enthusiasm for developing
            high-quality products, and that will help me grow as a developer
            with code reviews and peer support.
